In this repository contains handing imbalance data using under sampling and over sampling

Undersampling attempts to reduce the bias(error) associated with imbalanced classes of data. In machine learning, undersampling and oversampling are two techniques that deal with imbalances in a training set (the part of data used to fit a model). You can undersample the majority class, oversample the minority class, or combine the two techniques.
